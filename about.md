Hello!

My name is Zack McCauley, often using the alias WardsParadox for many things.

This is just a little bio page for my Github account. Funny enough, I am not a developer; at least in my eyes. I just on occasion tweak or explore things. Sometimes I write up my own little scripts and stuff for other to use if it helps them. I am currently trying to learn more about some of the languages my favorite projects.

I am always trying to help, but I like to help efficiently. That is why I always try to write BASH/Python scripts to help me out with that.

Thanks for stopping bye! ~ WardsParadox aka Zack McCauley
